Data tables

**DESeq2_output_18hr_Log2FC** - Log2 fold change (relative to vehicle treated) of differentially expressed genes as determined using DESeq2 for each microbial treatment after 18 hours of colonization. Genes that were not differentially expressed were given NA.

**DESeq2_output_18hr_P.adjust** - Adjusted P-value (FDR) of differentially expressed genes as determined using DESeq2 for each microbial treatment after 18 hours of colonization. Genes that were not differentially expressed were given NA.

**DESeq2_output_48hr_Log2FC** - Log2 fold change (relative to vehicle treated) of differentially expressed genes as determined using DESeq2 for each microbial treatment after 48 hours of colonization. Genes that were not differentially expressed were given NA.

**DESeq2_output_48hr_P.adjust** - Adjusted P-value (FDR) of differentially expressed genes as determined using DESeq2 for each microbial treatment after 48 hours of colonization. Genes that were not differentially expressed were given NA.
